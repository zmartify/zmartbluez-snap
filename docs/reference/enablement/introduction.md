## Device Enablement with Bluetooth

This page provides information about what are the requirements for an Ubuntu
Core system to support Bluetooth.

The Linux kernel section will tell about the Linux kernel requirements for
having BlueZ up and running on Ubuntu Core based systems.

The application development section will show what are the necessary bits in
the *snapcraft.yaml* to successfully snap an application that uses Bluetooth.

You can quickly jump to the chapters using the list below:

 - [Linux kernel supported versions](supported-kernels.html)
 - [Linux kernel configuration options](kernel-configuration-options.html)
 - [Snapping a Bluetooth application](snapping-bluetooth-enabled-application.html)
